Project Overview:


Dataset:



Utilized the House Prices:
Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle.

Data Extraction:
Extracted the dataset from a zip file.

Data Preparation:
Loaded the dataset and selected key features: GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, and FullBath.
Preprocessed the data by handling missing values.

Model Training:
Split the data into training and testing sets.

Trained a Linear Regression model on the training data.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score.
Achieved strong performance metrics on both training and testing sets.

Model Interpretation:
Printed the model coefficients to understand the impact of each feature.

Test Data Predictions:
Loaded the test dataset, prepared it, and made predictions.
Saved the predictions to a CSV file.
